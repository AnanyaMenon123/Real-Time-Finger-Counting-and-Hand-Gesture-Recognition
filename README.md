# Real-Time-Finger-Counting-and-Hand-Gesture-Recognition

This computer vision project focuses on real-time finger counting and hand gesture recognition. Leveraging OpenCV and Python, the system captures live video feeds from a webcam, detects hands within a designated region of interest, and accurately counts the displayed fingers. The approach includes background accumulation for robust hand detection, dynamic thresholding, and contour analysis for finger identification. Users can interact with the system through a friendly interface that displays live video streams and overlays, making it suitable for diverse applications such as interactive presentations, gaming, and accessibility solutions. The project showcases the power of computer vision techniques in tracking and recognizing hand gestures.
